Nagios status monitor for a NOC or operations room.

This naglite3 RPM is configured for Nagios use, but is easily compatible
with Icinga. Simply edit /var/www/nagalite3/config.php to point to
the Icinga status.dat file.

naglite3 is not published as tarballs, it's published as a github project.
The tarball is simply built from the github.com download.
